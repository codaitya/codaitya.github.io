## Hi there !

I am a Software Engineer who cares about inventing and building. Particularly as a software engineer I am interested in building resilient, readable and maintainable software. I am also interested in History and Economics and I have been trying to view the data points from computer scientist's perspective. I will do a write up on some of these soon. Wannabe crypto-mining and electronics enthusiast.
Recently I have been exploring the mental well being space and learning more about it.

Waiting for the precedented times to come back so that I can take my backpack and explore some little known places.
