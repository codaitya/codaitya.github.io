## Hi there !

I am Anand Kotriwal. I am a Software Engineer who cares about inventing and building. My personal motto is
> Change the world by building to solve problems that matter !

I am a wannabe crypto-mining and electronics enthusiast. Apart from my interest in technology, I love reading science fiction and non-fiction in the domain of history, economics and behavioural psychology. If you are looking for a book recommendation you can find them [here](https://anandkotriwal.com/reading/) .
Recently I have been exploring the mental well being space and learning more about it.

I am eagerly waiting for the precedented times to come back so that I can take my backpack and explore some less visited places.
