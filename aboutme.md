## Hi there !

I am Anand Kotriwal, a Software Engineer who cares about inventing and building. My personal motto is
> Change the world by building to solve problems that matter !

I am a wannabe crypto-mining and electronics enthusiast. Apart from my interest in technology I love reading science fiction and non-fiction in the domain of history, economics and behavioural psychology. If you are looking for a recommendation you can find them here. [Books](https://anandkotriwal.com/reading/)
Recently I have been exploring the mental well being space and learning more about it. If you want to discuss some ideas on it please reach out to me, I will be happy to discuss it.

Waiting for the precedented times to come back so that I can take my backpack and explore some less visited places.
