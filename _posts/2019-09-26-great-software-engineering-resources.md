In college I was all too consumed with sport programming. Some of the fondest memories of my college life include getting a solution to an arcane problem in the ICPC, the thrill of being the first ones in getting a problem accepted in an online contest, cracking an arcane problem in the computer labs late in the night with my team-mates. The learnings I had from these have stayed with me while I must have forgotten most of what was taught in the classroom.

Looking back I realized if you are having fun while solving an objective task you do no take it as a chore. A core component of the fun is the gamification that the tasks provide. So in this quest I have found a few platforms that provide that experience, not limited only to sport programming.

Heres my list
- [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/)
  Try building your own Git, Redis or docker.
- [Hackattic](https://hackattic.com/)
  Some real world problems that will teach you computer science.
- [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/)
  Want to learn some cryptography. Write code to do that.
- [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/)
  Traditional programming puzzles
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
  Problems with a bent of mathematics
