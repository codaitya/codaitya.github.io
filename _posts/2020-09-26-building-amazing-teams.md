In this blog I will be writing about building great teams. Recently two things occurred which gave me a chance to think about this topic. Firstly, I had a great conversation on this topic with a co-worker on the team. They are a brilliant engineer and a great co-worker. The points we discussed gave me food for thought.
Second, I read the book [Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39863447-loonshots). It is written by a physicist turned biotech entrepreneur Safi Bachall. In the book he visits the history of the major breakthroughs of mankind and tries to find a common link across all of them. The finding is that the major predictor of the success is the organisational culture and structure of the team that is working on it.I would highly recommend the book, its an amazing read.

I will distill the learnings from above and my personal experience into points I believe go into making a great team.

-Hire well
-Enable psychological safety in the team :
-Involve people in the mission :  man on the moon.
-Structure of the organization :  quote safi bachall
-Allow people to bring their true self :
