In this blog I will be writing about building great teams. Recently two things occurred which gave me a chance to think about this topic. Firstly, I had a great conversation on this topic with a co-worker on the team. They are a brilliant engineer and a great co-worker. The points we discussed gave me food for thought.
Second, I read the book [Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39863447-loonshots). It is written by a physicist turned biotech entrepreneur Safi Bachall. In the book he visits the history of the major breakthroughs of mankind and tries to find a common link across all of them. The finding is that the major predictor of the success is the organisational culture and structure of the team that is working on it.I would highly recommend the book, its an amazing read.

I will distill the learnings from above and my personal experience into points I believe go into making a great team.

- **Hire well** :
  Hiring well is often taken as to include the technical competencies of the candidate. It goes well beyond that. You need people who can fit and shine within the culture of your orgaznization. If you can align your people with the vision of your organization you have an unstoppable work force.
- **Enable psychological safety in the team** :
  In simpler terms you feel psychologically safe in your team if you can make mistakes take risk without fear. Studies show that a psychologically safe teams have less anxiety among its members, people can speak out freely which promotes diverse view points and they can innnovate faster.
  This is a great read.[High Performing teams need psychological safety](https://hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it).
- **Involve people in the mission** :  
  > In 1962, President John F. Kennedy visited NASA for the first time. During his tour of the facility, he met a janitor who was carrying a broom down the hallway. The President then casually asked the janitor what he did for NASA, and the janitor replied, “I’m helping put a man on the moon.”

  A workforce on mission can do wonders. When the people can derive meaning out of their work, they are motivated to put more than a hundred percent.

- **Allow people to bring their true self** :
- **Managers**
