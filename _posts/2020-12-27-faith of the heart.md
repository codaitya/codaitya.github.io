It's been a long road,  
To get from there to here.  
It's been a long time,  
But my time is finally here.  

And I can feel a change in the wind right now.  
Nothing's in my way.  
And they're not gonna hold me down no more.  
No they're not gonna hold me down.  

Cause I've got faith of the heart.  
I'm going where my heart will take me.  
I've got faith to believe.  
I can do anything.  
I've got strength of the soul.  
And no one's going to bend or break me.  
I can reach any star.  
I've got faith,  
I've got faith,  
Faith of the heart.
