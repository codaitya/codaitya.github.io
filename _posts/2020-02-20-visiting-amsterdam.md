In the third week of January I visited Amsterdam, the capital of Netherlands.
It was sponsored by Databricks, who invited me for an onsite interview. They took really good care of me. The complete experience from the logistics, to the stay was great. So thank you to the Databricks team.

The dutch love their bi-cycles and I was really pleased to see dedicated bi-cycle tracks. It is certainly a cyclists paradise. The effect of cycling can be seen on their physique, where the average citizen seemed to be quite fit.

Amsterdam is a canal city with canals criss crossing through its geography. There are numerous canal tours organized. From my hotel room I could see ships embarking and disembarking. It was a great sight.

If you happen to visit the city center area do try the dutch chocolates, they are a delicacy.
