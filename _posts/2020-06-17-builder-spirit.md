The image above depicts [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) taking his class at Caltech. I first came to know about Feynman during my high school days when I read his seminal [Feynman Lectures in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics)" . I did not understand all of it but the spark and passion in his teaching was clearly visible. My second encounter with Feynman was in the first days of University. It was my first week in college, it was scorching summers in Allahabad and I was getting bored. I headed to the college Library, one of the several places having Air-Conditioning (also yes I am a nerd!).
On skimming through the bookshelf in the biography section I came across a copy of [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!). The title seemed quite interesting and I read the first chapter and was hooked. I went ahead to borrow the book but I still did not have a library card yet. I ended up reading the complete book in the library through the night (ah the start of my all nighters in college).
Since then I have re-read parts of book multiple times and it still gives me joy and inspiration.

So what does Builder Spirit and Feynman have in common and why I am writing about it. Its the realisation that the country needs engineers with this spirit if it has to become self-sufficient. Its the sadness on seeing a nation of one billion cheering maniacally upon arrival of Rafale jets. Its the anger at the incompetence of our industries to produce ventilators upto the health standards at the time of pandemic. Its the despair on seeing India being the largest importer of technological arms and ammunitions.

India needs its engineers to rise upto the occasion. The problems of this country of 1.25 billions is an engineering and information problem and needs a scalable solution. Its time to build !
